## Next steps / future plans/ideas
- add more geometry elements
- change GE default to 0 / -1 rather than 0 / +1
- tidy up optimiser text output when not using tty
- optimiser
    - polarisation purity
    - current on a certain segment
    - feedline current (needs a feedline object tagged)
    - stretch / warp / sheer the 3D geometry
    - bandwidth
- Add gamma feeds? Does this need a component? Look at adding squalo maybe.
    - this links to adding models for feedline and common mode current minimisation in optimiser.
- Wireframe viewer
    - arrow pointing to specified gain direction
    - arrow pointing to max gain direction (with dBi & maybe F/B)
- Clutter / environment objects
    - dielectric slab (for brick walls, GRP panels etc)
    - other antennas
