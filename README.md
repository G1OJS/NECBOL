# Python Library to run NEC
This is a new work in progress, but already provides:
* Easy way to build antennas using a component library (rods/wires, loops etc)
* Automatic joining of wires that intersect (currently if a wire end lies on another wire)
* Easy setting of frequency, ground, azimuth and elevation of pattern point
* Extendable to sweep and optimise, tabulate and plot
